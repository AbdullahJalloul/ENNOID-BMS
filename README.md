# Update 

12/07/2018:
Analog device is offering a DC2350 development board with DC2026 linduino control board. The final design will be based on those development boards with major modifications in order to lower the cost and reach the requirement.


This project aims to create a scalable & modular open source BMS for up to 1000V lithium-ion battery packs.
